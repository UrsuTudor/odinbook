Users can now make posts and they are visible on the index page. A user's posts are also visible on their own page:
- allow users to like posts
  - fix the issue of posts not being like-able right after creation; post_id is not being found by like form
  - fix the issue of subsequent posts not updating after liking a first post
- allow users to comment on posts
